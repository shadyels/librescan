LibreScan - AI-powered bookshelf scanner and book recommendation engine

This my pet project to learn some AI stuff as I go, full of useless commentary because of that.

I will upload a proper ReadMe anyway at some point.

React and Vite
Deployed on Vercel Serverless 

I used Qwen2.5-VL-7B as my vision model (future plan to add 72B option)
Pulled book caches from Google Books
Model for recommendations TBD
